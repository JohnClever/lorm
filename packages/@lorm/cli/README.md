## üì¶ Installation

**Install the CLI as a dev dependency in your React Native/Expo project:**

```bash
# Navigate to your React Native or Expo project
cd my-react-native-app

# Install Lorm CLI locally
npm install @lorm/cli --save-dev

# Or with pnpm
pnpm add @lorm/cli -D

# Or with yarn
yarn add @lorm/cli --dev
```

**Use the CLI via npx/pnpm dlx (no global installation needed):**

```bash
# Using npx (npm)
npx @lorm/cli <command>

# Using pnpm dlx (pnpm)
pnpm dlx @lorm/cli <command>

# Using yarn
yarn @lorm/cli <command>
```

> üéØ **Mobile-First Philosophy**: Lorm CLI is designed to be project-scoped within your mobile application. This ensures version consistency, eliminates global dependency conflicts, and keeps your mobile development environment clean and predictable.

## üöÄ Quick Start for React Native/Expo

**Prerequisites:** You should have an existing React Native or Expo project.

1. **Navigate to your mobile project and install Lorm CLI:**
   ```bash
   cd my-react-native-app
   npm install @lorm/cli --save-dev
   ```

2. **Initialize Lorm in your mobile project:**
   ```bash
   npx @lorm/cli init
   ```

3. **Configure your database connection in `lorm.config.js`**
   ```javascript
   // lorm.config.js
   export default {
     database: {
       url: process.env.DATABASE_URL || "your-database-url"
     }
   };
   ```

4. **Define your schema in `lorm.schema.js`** (example users table included)

5. **Push your schema to the database:**
   ```bash
   npx @lorm/cli push
   ```

6. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npx @lorm/cli dev
   ```

7. **Install the client in your React Native/Expo app:**
   ```bash
   npm install @lorm/client
   ```

8. **Use type-safe APIs in your mobile app:**
   ```typescript
   import { createClient } from '@lorm/client';
   
   const client = createClient({
     url: 'http://localhost:3000' // Your Lorm server
   });
   
   // Fully typed API calls
   const users = await client.getUsers();
   ```
