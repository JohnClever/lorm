# Performance System Separation - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Product Overview

This document outlines the requirements for separating the performance monitoring system from the caching system in @lorm/core to achieve clear separation of concerns. The goal is to create a dedicated, reusable performance monitoring framework that can monitor any system component, not just caching operations.

The separation will improve modularity, reduce coupling between systems, enable independent scaling and optimization, and provide a foundation for comprehensive application performance monitoring across the entire @lorm ecosystem.

## 2. Core Features

### 2.1 User Roles

| Role | Registration Method | Core Permissions |
|------|---------------------|------------------|
| Developer | Direct API access | Can configure monitoring, view metrics, set up alerts |
| System Administrator | Configuration-based setup | Can manage global monitoring settings, export data, configure thresholds |
| Application User | Automatic integration | Receives performance insights through application interfaces |

### 2.2 Feature Module

Our performance system separation consists of the following main components:

1. **Performance Core Module**: standalone performance monitoring engine, metrics collection framework, alerting system.
2. **Cache Integration Layer**: lightweight adapter connecting cache operations to performance system, cache-specific metric definitions.
3. **Universal Monitoring Interface**: generic monitoring APIs for any system component, plugin architecture for custom metrics.
4. **Configuration Management**: environment-specific performance settings, dynamic threshold management, monitoring profiles.
5. **Data Export & Visualization**: metrics export capabilities, integration with external monitoring tools, performance dashboards.
6. **Testing & Validation**: performance system unit tests, integration testing framework, benchmark validation tools.

| Testing | Unit Test Suite | Comprehensive test coverage for performance system, mock performance scenarios, validate metric accuracy |
| Testing | Integration Tests | Test performance system with real components, validate end-to-end monitoring workflows, performance regression testing |

## 3. Core Process

### System Architecture Flow

The performance system operates independently from the cache system while providing monitoring capabilities through well-defined interfaces. Components register with the performance system, which collects metrics, processes alerts, and provides data export capabilities.

**Initialization Flow**: Performance system starts ‚Üí Components register monitoring interfaces ‚Üí Metrics collection begins ‚Üí Alert thresholds configured

**Monitoring Flow**: Component operations trigger events ‚Üí Performance system captures metrics ‚Üí Data aggregation and analysis ‚Üí Alert evaluation ‚Üí Notification dispatch

**Integration Flow**: Cache system implements monitoring interface ‚Üí Performance adapter translates cache events ‚Üí Generic performance metrics generated ‚Üí Standard alerting and export available
