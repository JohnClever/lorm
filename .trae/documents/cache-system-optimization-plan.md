# Cache System Optimization Plan - Technical Specification

## 1. Product Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive optimization plan for the @lorm/core cache system to enhance performance, reliability, and scalability. The plan addresses current limitations through systematic improvements including async operations, reliability enhancements, and advanced configuration management.

The optimization targets improved cache hit rates (>80%), reduced response times (<10ms), enhanced reliability (99.9% uptime), and better scalability to handle 10x current load while maintaining backward compatibility.

## 2. Core Features

### 2.1 Feature Module

Our cache system optimization consists of the following main implementation phases:

1. **Performance Benchmarking Suite**: comprehensive testing framework, baseline metrics collection, performance monitoring infrastructure.
2. **Async Operations Enhancement**: streaming compression implementation, batch operations support, memory pool management.
3. **Reliability Improvements**: circuit breaker pattern, atomic file operations, checksum validation.
4. **Scalability Enhancements**: partitioned storage system, background cleanup workers, memory pressure detection.
5. **Configuration Management**: environment-specific profiles, dynamic configuration updates, configurable eviction policies.
6. **Testing & Monitoring**: comprehensive test suite, load testing framework, observability infrastructure.

## 3. Core Process

### Implementation Flow

The optimization process follows a phased approach starting with establishing performance baselines, then implementing core performance improvements, followed by reliability enhancements, scalability improvements, and finally configuration management features.

**Phase 1 - Foundation (Weeks 1-2)**: Establish benchmarking suite and baseline metrics
**Phase 2 - Performance (Weeks 3-5)**: Implement async compression, batch operations, and memory pooling
**Phase 3 - Reliability (Weeks 6-8)**: Add circuit breakers, atomic operations, and data integrity checks
**Phase 4 - Scalability (Weeks 9-11)**: Implement partitioned storage, background workers, and memory management
**Phase 5 - Configuration (Weeks 12-13)**: Add environment profiles, dynamic configuration, and eviction policies
